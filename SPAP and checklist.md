
# Following is the checklist 
  * 1. Understand the data, what are the features? What are the datatypes?
  2. Ask the right question, which we can answer from its analysis.
  3. Data cleaning - dealing with missing data 
        Removing Nulls 
        or 
        Imputation with mean value or 0 depending on data 
  4. Data exploration and visualization
        Boxplot
        Bivariate boxplot - Bvplot
        Histograms 
        Scatterplot
        3D Scatterplot
        Chullplot
        Chiplot
        Scatterplot with linear fit 
        Pairs for checking variance
  5. Data variance - univariate and multivariate inorder to find which are useful features which can help answer the question
        T test
        Hotelling T squared Test
        F test
        Leven test
